LSDj Wave Channel Synth Patches

This is a repository of LSDj Wave Channel Synths that have been converted using the [LSDj Wave Cruncher](https://github.com/urbster1/lsdj-wave-cruncher/releases).

You can patch these files into your LSDj .lsdsng's by using Stijn Frishert's [liblsdj wavetable patcher tool](https://github.com/stijnfrishert/liblsdj/releases). (note: this tool is used from the terminal aka the command line!)<br />
Usage:<br />
`lsdj-wavetable-import [savefile.sav|song.lsdsng] [synth.snt] [0-15 or 0-F]`

The "single-cycles" folder contains LSDj wave instrument patches that are only meant to be used with the LSDj Wave Synth in MANUAL mode. Included in this folder are the following:
* waveforms used by Alberto Gonzalez (the mcalby snt files)
* a variety of wavetables from the Adventure Kid Serum wavetable pack (akserum snt files)
* wavetables used in various games [as archived by sdhizumi and scythe.](https://scythe1005.wixsite.com/gb-waveforms) (more coming soon!)
* the [slap bass patch from tobokegao's cover of the Seinfeld theme](https://twitter.com/to6okegao/status/1047236322320998401) 
* an [organ patch from fluxer of cmo.o](https://chipmusic.org/forums/topic/8137/lsdj-organ-patch-how/)
* SCC wavetables compiled by MelonadeM
