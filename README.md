LSDj Wave Channel Synth Patches

This is a repository of LSDj Wave Channel Synths that have been converted using the [LSDj Wave Cruncher](https://github.com/urbster1/lsdj-wave-cruncher/releases).

You can patch these files into your LSDj .lsdsng's by using Stijn Frishert's [liblsdj wavetable patcher tool](https://github.com/stijnfrishert/liblsdj/releases). (note: this tool is used from the terminal aka the command line!)

The "single-cycles" folder contains LSDj wave instrument patches that are only meant to be used with the LSDj Wave Synth in MANUAL mode. Included in this folder are waveforms used by Alberto Gonzalez (the mcalby snt files), as well as a variety of wavetables from the Adventure Kid Serum wavetable pack (akserum snt files). It also contains wavetables used in various games [as archived by sdhizumi and scythe.](https://scythe1005.wixsite.com/gb-waveforms) (more coming soon!)
