LSDj Wave Channel Synth Patches

This is a repository of LSDj Wave Channel Synths that have been converted using the [LSDj Wave Cruncher](https://github.com/urbster1/lsdj-wave-cruncher/releases).

You can patch these files into your LSDj .lsdsng's by using Stijn Frishert's [liblsdj wavetable patcher tool](https://github.com/stijnfrishert/liblsdj/releases). (note: this tool is used with Terminal aka the command line!)

More details forthcoming ;)
